### Variables

Variables are defined using the 'var' keyword:

```scala
var name: String = "Sherlock"
```
Result:
```scala
name: String = Sherlock
```


Notice that the type of variables is declared after the variable name separated by a colon mark.

Another way to declare variables:

```scala
var name = "John"
```

Result:
```scala
name: String = John
```

Scala can infer the types in most cases so it is not necessary to declare variable types explicity.

Moreover, as you saw the data of variables can change.
In the second statement we changed the data of variable name to "John". Variables in Scala are mutable.
